GIT  - It is a version control system


GITHUB - 
X  - writes some code and creates testcases "A" - //  6-10 2nd component  EST   - GITHUB
Y  -                                          IST 


Y had 5 line of code // 1-5  line (first componenet)


X will keep the code in github and y will take it


GIT is smart enough to know the difference of code
GIT will be responsible for merging

You need to know the git command to talk to central repository (GIT Hub or Bit Bucket ) from where you can take the code



Tell Git who you are 
git config --global user.name "Abdul"
git config --global user.email "abdul.cool987@gmail.com"

I told tha git that my name is Abdul and email adress is xyz and I am the one who will be talking with guthub
